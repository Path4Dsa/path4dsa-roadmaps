Security reports primarily focus on:

- Malicious links  
- Unsafe external resources  
- Harmful or misleading content  
- Spam, phishing, or advertisements  
- Abuse of the contribution system  
- Attempts to upload harmful files  
- Attempts to bypass project rules or branch protection

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability or find content that may be harmful, please report it privately.

```

Include:

- A clear description of the issue  
- The file(s) involved  
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
- Reason why it is a potential security concern

## What Not To Report

The following should NOT be reported as security issues:

- Typographical errors  
- Broken links  
- Missing roadmap topics  
- Formatting issues  
- Incorrect data inside roadmaps  
- Requests for new roadmaps  
- Contribution questions  

These should be submitted as regular GitHub Issues or Pull Requests instead.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please follow responsible disclosure practices:

- Do not publicly share vulnerabilities  
- Do not post information in GitHub Issues  
- Do not attempt to exploit or test vulnerabilities on other contributors  
- Do not upload executable scripts or harmful files  
- Do not bypass branch protection rules  

All valid reports will be acknowledged privately and resolved promptly.

## Maintaining Repository Integrity

To ensure the security and cleanliness of contributions:

- Only Markdown files are allowed  
- Contributors must follow the roadmap template  
- All links must be from trusted and safe sources  
- Harmful, malicious, or unrelated content will be removed  
- Persistent harmful attempts may result in being blocked from contributing  

Maintainers reserve the right to decline contributions that violate safety or quality guidelines.
