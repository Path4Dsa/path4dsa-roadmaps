# What This Repository Contains

This project stores all Roadmaps in easy-to-read Markdown files.

# Before You Contribute

Contributions do not go directly into the main branch.  
You cannot push or overwrite files directly.  
All changes must come through a pull request (PR).

This protects the project from accidental deletion, broken files, or harmful content.

You will contribute through a fork of the repository.
